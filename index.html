      <p>Animal Shelter is a nonprofit organization that finds homes for abandoned cats and dogs throughout the Portland-metro area, and provides behavior intervention when needed to improve chances of adoption.  Founded in 1967, we operate an animal shelter in Portland. We also provide programs that enhance the bond between animals and people.
